A stack represents a set of robust components & modular technologies that allow users to develop powerful and enterprise-grade applications. Similarly, a data analytics stack encompasses diverse technologies that let users and businesses build a robust analytics engine to aggregate, integrate, model and trahavae imnsform data from numerous data sources.A data warehouse allows users to consolidate and aggregate data from numerous data sources in a centralised location.
